## Julian's notes

* 20180423: erb templates properly bootstrapped and just added an action mailer

* 20180217: stopped at opportunities/index.html.erb

* 20180125: added mods to git, updated app(s) with the github - paperclip vulnerability warning, navbar already updated
for the opportunities path.  Add whole app to github (now that sqlite3 has been added to gitignore.
Next up; write a custom validation in the opportunity model to make sure that the organisation_id is the same as the
person.organisation_id.

* 20171220: check back with the Agile book on page: 57
